    <p class="head"> Dear Kelsie,<span class="txt">
        This is my first project and it may not be perfect but 
    I wanna dedicate it to you, and our relationship.
    I love you. I know I don't always show it in the most 
    romantic ways but I do. I know that everything about 
    our relationship may not be perfect. Especially us being
    long distance. Even with that I wouldn't change anything
    if that meant losing you. I don't mind the difficulties we
    face because I know that God will see us through. I don't wanna
    make this to emotionally sappy, but just know that I am 
    going no where and I will see this through to the end.
